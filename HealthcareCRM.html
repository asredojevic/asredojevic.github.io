				<h6>PROBLEM</h6>
				<h2 class="portfolio">Consolidated Campaign Experience</h2>

				<div class="left-box">
				<p style="text-align:left;">After acquiring a competitor, my team and I conducted an analysis between our two CRM tools with a goal of designing a consolidated campaign experience that reflected the healthcare marketing funnel.</p>
				<p>To create this new experience, we needed to understand how marketers plan and execute their campaigns.</p>

		<h6 style="text-align:left;">RESEARCH</h6>
		<h2 class="portfolio">Hospital Marketers</h2>
			<p> We interviewed 15 hospital marketers and with the goal of understanding their campaign process. <span style= "background-color: rgba(211, 234, 110, .85); font-weight:bold;">We wanted to know how they researched, built, and reported on campaigns and the relationship between tactics and channels.</span>
			</p>
			<p>From those interviews, we were able to understand the marketing nomenclature and process.

			<h6>TESTING</h6>
			<h2 class="portfolio">Campaign Structure</h2>
			<div>
				<p>After defining a typical marketer process, we developed two campaign structure concepts. Option One kept all the elements the marketer needs under the parent of the campaign. Option Two associated the elements under a specific tactic. We tested the concepts with 5 users and 3 potential clients.</p>

				<p> <span style= "background-color: rgba(211, 234, 110, .85); font-weight:bold;">Most participants preferred Option Two. When asked how well the process matched how they execute their campaigns the average score 4.125 out of 5.</span> </p>

			<h6> SOLUTION</h6>
			<h2 class="portfolio">Interface Development</h2>
			<div class="left-box">
			<p>With the preliminary research and an audit of the existing page the team was able to brainstorm concepts. </p>
			<p>We added the 'tactics page' to the sub navigation to reflect the new structure. This allowed users to access all tactics and associated audiences and tracking. </p>
			<p>We used dynamic cards to represent tactics.  The card design focused on guiding the user to relevant information and actions per  specific channel. </p>
			<p>From user feedback, we learned campaigns can have up to 50 tactics so collapse functionality was added so users could easily scan the page. </p>

				<p><span style= "background-color: rgba(211, 234, 110, .85); font-weight:bold;">We tested the design with 5 users. When asked how well the design supported how they built their marketing campaigns the average score was 4.5 out of 5.</span></p>
