		<h2 class="portfolio">Consolidated Campaign Experience</h2>

		<div class="left-box">
		<p style="text-align:left;">After acquiring a competitor, my team was tasked with conducting an analysis between the two Custom Relationship Management tools and designing a consolidated Campaign experience that reflected the healthcare marketing funnel.</p>
		<p>To create this new campaign experience we had to understand how marketers strategize, plan, and execute their campaigns.</p>

<h6 style="text-align:left;">RESEARCH</h6>
<h2 class="portfolio">Hospital Marketers</h2>
<p> We interviewed around 15 hospital marketers and <span style= "background-color: rgba(211, 234, 110, .85); font-weight:bold;">focused on discovering the elements used within a campaign, how those elements relate to each other and how marketers expected those elements to be reported on. </span> </p>

<p>From those interviews we were able to understand the marketers process outlined below </p>

	<h6>TESTING</h6>
	<h2 class="portfolio">Campaign Structure</h2>
	<div>
		<p>After defining a typical marketer process, two campaign structure concepts were developed. Option One kept all the elements the marketer needs under the parent of the campaign, where Option Two associated the elements under a specific tactic. The concepts were tested with 5 users and 3 potential clients.</p>
		<div class="left-box"> <span style="font-weight: bold;"> Option One </span></div>
		<div class="right-box"> <span style="font-weight: bold;">Option Two</span></div>
		<div style="clear:both;"></div>
			<div>
			<img style="padding:36px 0 36px 0;" src="images/campaignStructure@2x.png">
			</div>
		<p> <span style= "background-color: rgba(211, 234, 110, .85); font-weight:bold;">Most participants preferred Option Two. When asked how well the process matched how they execute their campaigns the average score 4.125 out of 5.</span> </p>

	<h6> SOLUTION</h6>
	<h2 class="portfolio">Interface Development</h2>
	<p>From that feedback we removed the description field and changed the visual treatment to a modal. Instead of using text input fields, we created a smart typeahead drop down fields. For example if you selected a category and then proceeded to the manufacturing dropdown, you would only be able to select manufacturerâ€™s from the selected category. </p>
