		<h6>PROBLEM</h6>
		<h2 class="portfolio">'Where are the filters…'</h2>
		<p> Arrow.com has millions of parts on their site and each part is classified into a category and sub category. Due to the product library size,<span style= "background-color: rgba(211, 234, 110, .85); font-weight:bold;"> users MUST select a product category after a search term is entered to display relevant filters.</span> Through user testing and google analytics, I realized users were missing this critical step in the search journey.</p>

		<h6>RESEARCH</h6>
		<h2 class="portfolio">Filter Best Practice</h2>
		<div class="left-box">
			<p>In an ideal experience, users would not have to select a category and the filters would appear based on the user search term (magic!). Due to time, I knew that was not something I would be able to quickly solve or pitch to my team as an ‘MVP’ solution.</p>
			<p>Instead, I wondered if there was a way to solve this problem through the user flow and/or interface. I started researching how other companies with large product libraries were solving this problem. </p>

		<h6>TESTING</h6>
		<h2 class="portfolio"> Competitor Analysis</h2>
		<div class="left-box">
			<p>I conducted an unmoderated remote user test with 15 electrical engineers. They were asked to search for a specific part on our website, a competitor’s website and amazon.</p>
			<p>The goal of the test was to determine: <br>
				<ol>
				<li>When in the user journey should we display part categories </li>
				<li>Where is the best place to display part categories and other filters</li>
				</ol>
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="right-box">

		</div>
		<div style="clear:both;"></div>
		<p>Users expressed that <span style= "background-color: rgba(211, 234, 110, .85); font-weight:bold;">it felt 'disjointed' to stop them before reaching their search results and preferred the categories displayed on the result page. They also preferred the filters above the results,</span> believing that they would overlook the filters if they were on the left rail.
		</p>
	</div>

	<div class="content">
		<h6>SOLUTION</h6>
		<h2 class="portfolio">Interface Design</h2>
		<p>To increase user engagement, I prioritized the category filter on the search page. To reduce user frustration and time spent on page, I pulled the filter to the top of the page and designed a different visual treatment. Users could select a category and drill down into subcategories until they found the specific filters needed. We tested this feature by running an AB test against the original design.

		<div class="right-box" style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold; ">
			<span>OPTION B</span>
		<img src="images/SearchDesktop-CatFilterB@2x.png" />
		</div>

		<div style="clear:both;"></div>

		<p style="padding:36px 0 36px 0;">We declared <span style= "background-color: rgba(211, 234, 110, .85); font-weight:bold;">OPTION B was declared the winner, doubling engagement </span>from the original design.
