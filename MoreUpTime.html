<h3>More Up Time Campaign</h3>
<h4>layout, infographics, marketing material</h4>
<p>Wazee Companies, LLC provides electrical and mechanical solutions to aerospace, manufacturing, municipalities, mining, power generation, oil and gas and other heavy industrial customers through three business segments: Electric, Crane and Wind. In 2013 Wazee became a Timken Brand and has adopted their parent company's colors while still maintaining their own look and feel in the industry. The wind tradeshow material produced is similar to the parent company's clean and streamlined design aesthetic. The layering within the piece is attributed to the multiple aspects of Wazee Companies and how they all work together simultaneously.
