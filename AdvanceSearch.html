	<p style="text-align:left;"> <strong>PROBLEM</strong> <br>From a survey sent out quarterly, we received feedback that users were experiencing difficulty searching over 3 million parts and found that our search algorithm only returned valuable results when users entered a specific part number.<br>
	After looking at what our users were entering into the search bar, we discovered that around 58% of arrow.com searches were either family names, part numbers or part names. Meaning we were only capturing users at the end of their sourcing journey instead of the beginning.

<p> <strong>RESEARCH </strong><br>The journey an engineer goes through to source parts can be pretty complex but it does usually follow a similar flow in the image below. From user interviews we discovered that at the research point, our users typically know the specific category and some constraint of the part they need but since our search performed best when searching part numbers we were losing sessions and possibly conversions due to users not being able to research on arrow.com.

	<p style="text-align:left;">Our first thought was to expose how our search algorithm runs though our data (image of looping) by providing fields to the user and have them manually enter data into each field. Through remote user testing  feedback we discovered our users:</p>
	<ul style="text-align:left;">
		<li>had concerns about entering the content into the correct text field and spelling mistakes </li>
		<li>were confused on the difference between search term and description fields </li>
		<li>were confused by the full page take over and werenâ€™t able to use the browser back button </li>

	</ul>

<p>After our test reached significance <strong> OPTION B was declared the winner</strong>, doubling engagement from the original design.
